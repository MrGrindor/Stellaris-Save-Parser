This is simple Save Parser for the game Stellaris written with .Net. It will reiterate through a provide save file and retrieve game information like planets, pops, systems, empires, buildings, fleets, etc. 

This save parser is not comprehensive and will not retrieve all information from a save file. However it is reasonably easy to expand.

This Save Parser will see no further development it has served it's purpose.
